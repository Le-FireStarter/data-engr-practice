# Week 1 Practice

This has been an interesting week of learning.
Learning more about Docker and the amazing ways it can be used, the answer(s) to the big "Why Docker?" question and the benefits.

It's been fun practicing with different docker images.

Here is where I practiced all the lessons from Week 1. 

Learnt how to create a basic dockerfile and a basic python code.
Called the python code from the docker file.
Tested the dockerfile using docker build and docker run commands from Bash.
Modified the pipeline.py code to create a POSTGRES instance - user, password, DB and DB volumes.
